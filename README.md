Window Title Tweak
==================
As a user of ProcrastiTracker, I like to have precise statistics for each file in all projects. So I made a Brackets extension to add project name into the title!

Here are a few examples of how the title might look:
 - **Brackets** (default app name)
 - **File - file.html** (file outside project)
 - **File - folder/file.html** (file outside project)
 - **Project - MyProject** (open project with no open files)
 - **Project - MyProject - file.html** (open project with an open file)
 - **Project - MyProject - folder/file.html** (open project with an open file)

Since this is my first extension, there might be some bugs, so please report anything peculiar you find.

Installation Guide
==================
(whenever it's actually here)
Right-click the **Download ZIP** button on the right side, click **Copy Link Location** or whatever your browser calls it, open **File - Extension Manager...** in Brackets, click **Install from URL...** and paste the link you copied.
